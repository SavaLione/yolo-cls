# Contributing to yolo-cls
First off, thank you for considering contributing to yolo-cls!
It's people like you that make open source such a great community.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, [make one](https://github.com/savalione/yolo-cls/issues/new/choose)!
It's generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your feature request this way before starting to code.

### Getting Started
1.  **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2.  **Clone your fork** to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/savalione/yolo-cls.git`
3.  **Create a new branch** for your changes: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
4.  **Install dependencies and build the project** by following the instructions in our `README.md`.
5.  **Make your changes**, and be sure to test them.
6.  **Commit your changes** with a clear commit message.
7.  **Push to your fork** on GitHub: `git push origin my-new-feature`
8.  **Create a Pull Request** from your fork to the main `yolo-cls` repository.

## Pull Request Process
1.  Ensure any build or install dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2.  Update the `README.md` with details of changes to the interface, if applicable.
3.  You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of at least one other developer, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the reviewer to merge it for you.
